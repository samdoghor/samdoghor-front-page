Built Vue 3 + Vite Template, Tailwind and deployed to Vercel.

This template should help you get started developing with Vue 3 using Vite. The template makes use of Vue 3's `<script setup>` SFCs, which provide a more concise and streamlined syntax for script blocks. To learn more about `<script setup>`, check out the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Recommended IDE Setup

We recommend the following IDE setup for the best development experience:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (Disable Vetur if installed)
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)
